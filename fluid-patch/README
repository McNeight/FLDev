Fluid Patch for fltk version 1.1.4

This patch adds a F12-shortcut to fluid, that does "save, write code and exit",
so you can switch between FLDev and fluid with F12.
I recommend to disable "Show Completion Dialogs" in fluid GUI Settings.

INSTALL:

		$ cp fluid_patch_fltk-1.1.4.diff /path/to/fltk-1.1.4/
		$ cd /path/to/fltk-1.1.4
		$ patch < fluid_patch_fltk-1.1.4.diff
		$ cd fluid
		$ make

as root:	$ make install
