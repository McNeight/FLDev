Installation of FlDev

FlDev requires that the gcc compiler and, if you want to develop FLTK programs, 
the FLTK library including fluid have already been installed on your computer. 
Gcc will usually be installed with your distribution. You can check that by 
entering "gcc" on the command line and you will get the response: "no input files". 
If you have not used FLTK 1.3.x before download that from the repository of your 
distribution.

Please copy the fldev130a_x11.tgz file into your home directory. Then get into a 
terminal window and change your current directory to your home directory. 
E.g. with "cd ~". Then unpack the file with the command: "tar xvzf fldev130a_x11.tgz". 
This will generate a new directory called "fldev" in your home directory. 

Now enter the fldev directory. There is no "configure" step required nor implemented. 
Just execute "make" plus "sudo install.sh". This will copy the fldev program into 
/usr/local/bin and put the cpp documentation and the .fldev_cfg file into your home 
directory. 

Now enter "fldev" on the command line and the FlDev window will be displayed. If it does 
not compile, there is a backup fldev-sav executable and a backup Makefile-sav in the fldev 
directory which you can copy and retry.
